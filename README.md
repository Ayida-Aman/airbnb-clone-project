- Develop RESTful APIs for seamless frontend–backend communication
- Implement secure user authentication and booking workflows
- Learn to collaborate effectively with defined team roles
- Apply best practices in web development and deployment

### 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (or similar component-based framework)
- Figma for UI/UX design

**Backend**
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL (based on preference)
- Authentication with JWT or OAuth

**Version Control**
- Git & GitHub

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

### 📌 Design Goals
- Create an intuitive and seamless property booking flow
- Ensure visual and functional consistency across components
- Prioritize mobile-first and responsive layouts
- Optimize for performance and fast load times
- Adhere to accessibility guidelines for inclusive design

### ✨ Key Features
- Dynamic property search with filters (location, price, amenities)
- Detailed property pages with images, host info, and booking form
- Streamlined checkout with secure payment processing
- User authentication and profile management
- Reusable and consistent UI components for maintainability

### 📄 Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name                 | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with filtering and sorting options. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows full property details, host info, image gallery, reviews, and booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Collects booking and payment details, and confirms reservation.             |

### 🧠 Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A user-friendly interface is essential for building trust and ensuring conversions in a booking system. Clear navigation, responsive interactions, and intuitive layouts reduce friction in the user journey—especially on mobile devices. A well-designed UI improves accessibility, reduces support requests, and ultimately enhances the overall customer experience, contributing to higher user satisfaction and platform loyalty.

#### 🧩 Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Understanding the visual language of a design mockup is essential for a consistent and accessible user interface. Identifying properties like color and typography ensures:

- **Brand Consistency:** Keeps visual tone aligned across all pages and platforms
- **Developer Efficiency:** Allows seamless handoff from design to code
- **User Clarity:** Enhances readability, hierarchy, and intuitive interaction
- **Accessibility:** Enables designers and developers to meet usability standards across devices and audiences

When teams speak a shared design language from mockup to implementation, it speeds up collaboration and results in a polished, user-centered product.
